# Practical Frontent Developer Project

On this repository is all the work that I made for the Practical Frontent Developer Course Project at Platzi. 

## JavaScriptCourse Branch

It contains the content for the JavaScript Course Project which consists of merging the templates from this Frontent Developer Course Project into one page or file. That file is named index.html in the JavaScriptCourse branch.
